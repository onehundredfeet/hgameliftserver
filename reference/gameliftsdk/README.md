# Amazon GameLift C# Server SDK

## Documentation

You can find the official Amazon GameLift documentation [here](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/gamelift/).

## Building the SDK

### Instructions

Steps:

1. Open `GameLiftServerSDK.sln` solution in [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)
2. Restore NuGet packages
3. Configure **Target Framework** to `.NET 6` or `.NET 4.6.2`
4. Configure **MSBuild version** to 17.0 if the **Target Framework** is `.NET 6`
5. Configure **Platform** to specify the processor architecture you want to build your game server for. Set to `x64` for Intel processors, or `arm64` for Arm-based processors
6. Build project
7. Locate the build artifacts in `bin/` directory

### Configuring the C# linter

Each linter option is specified by a series of letters and numbers, e.g., S5753. You can disable options globally in `GameLiftServerSDK.ruleset`, or disable them locally using:

```csharp
#pragma warning disable S1147  // Disables S1147 until it is re-enabled using 'restore' after
    Environment.Exit(-1);
#pragma warning restore S1147
```

If you wish to know more about a SonarLint option, please look it up here: https://rules.sonarsource.com/csharp/RSPEC-6354. Note that you should replace "6354" with the number after the "S" of the option you want to search. For example, option "S1147" would be [RSPEC-1147](https://rules.sonarsource.com/csharp/RSPEC-1147).

## Usage

### Using the SDK in a C# console application

Steps:

1. Create a new console application project
2. Add the build artifact `GameLiftServerSDK.dll` to the project
3. To build successfully, you might need to include the dependent DLLs or manually restore the dependencies in the NuGet package manager

Below is a console application that showcases a simple game server initialization with Amazon GameLiftï¼š

```csharp
using Aws.GameLift.Server;
using Aws.GameLift.Server.Model;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var server = new GameLiftServerExampleBehavior();
        server.Start();
    }
}

public class GameLiftServerExampleBehavior
{
    //This is an example of a simple integration with Amazon GameLift server SDK that will make game server processes go active on Amazon GameLift!
    public void Start()
    {
        //Identify port number (hard coded here for simplicity) the game server is listening on for player connections
        var listeningPort = 7777;

        //WebSocketUrl from RegisterHost call
        var webSocketUrl = "wss://us-west-2.api.amazongamelift.com";

        //Unique identifier for this process
        var processId = "myProcess";

        //Unique identifier for your host that this process belongs to
        var hostId = "myHost";

        //Unique identifier for your fleet that this host belongs to
        var fleetId = "myFleet";

        //Authentication token for this host process.
        var authToken = "myAuthToken";

        ServerParameters serverParameters = new ServerParameters(
            webSocketUrl,
            processId,
            hostId,
            fleetId,
            authToken);

        //InitSDK will establish a local connection with Amazon GameLift's agent to enable further communication.
        var initSDKOutcome = GameLiftServerAPI.InitSDK(serverParameters);
        if (initSDKOutcome.Success)
        {
            ProcessParameters processParameters = new ProcessParameters(
                (GameSession gameSession) =>
                {
                    //When a game session is created, Amazon GameLift sends an activation request to the game server and passes along the game session object containing game properties and other settings.
                    //Here is where a game server should take action based on the game session object.
                    //Once the game server is ready to receive incoming player connections, it should invoke GameLiftServerAPI.ActivateGameSession()
                    GameLiftServerAPI.ActivateGameSession();
                },
                (UpdateGameSession updateGameSession) =>
                {
                    //When a game session is updated (e.g. by FlexMatch backfill), Amazon GameLift sends a request to the game
                    //server containing the updated game session object.  The game server can then examine the provided
                    //matchmakerData and handle new incoming players appropriately.
                    //updateReason is the reason this update is being supplied.
                },
                () =>
                {
                    //OnProcessTerminate callback. Amazon GameLift will invoke this callback before shutting down an instance hosting this game server.
                    //It gives this game server a chance to save its state, communicate with services, etc., before being shut down.
                    //In this case, we simply tell Amazon GameLift we are indeed going to shutdown.
                    GameLiftServerAPI.ProcessEnding();
                },
                () =>
                {
                    //This is the HealthCheck callback.
                    //GameLift will invoke this callback every 60 seconds or so.
                    //Here, a game server might want to check the health of dependencies and such.
                    //Simply return true if healthy, false otherwise.
                    //The game server has 60 seconds to respond with its health status. Amazon GameLift will default to 'false' if the game server doesn't respond in time.
                    //In this case, we're always healthy!
                    return true;
                },
                listeningPort, //This game server tells Amazon GameLift that it will listen on port 7777 for incoming player connections.
                new LogParameters(new List<string>()
                {
                    //Here, the game server tells Amazon GameLift what set of files to upload when the game session ends.
                    //Amazon GameLift will upload everything specified here for the developers to fetch later.
                    "/local/game/logs/myserver.log"
                }));

            //Calling ProcessReady tells Amazon GameLift this game server is ready to receive incoming game sessions!
            var processReadyOutcome = GameLiftServerAPI.ProcessReady(processParameters);
            if (processReadyOutcome.Success)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("ProcessReady success.");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("ProcessReady failure : " + processReadyOutcome.Error.ToString());
            }
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("InitSDK failure : " + initSDKOutcome.Error.ToString());
        }
    }

    void Shutdown()
    {
        //Make sure to call GameLiftServerAPI.Destroy() when the application quits. This resets the local connection with Amazon GameLift's agent.
        GameLiftServerAPI.Destroy();
    }
}

### Using the SDK in Unity

We recommend using the Amazon GameLift Server SDK Plugin for Unity. It is a lightweight plugin that provides the same SDK functionalities and supports Unity Package Manager.

You can find the tarball and setup instructions in the Unity bundle.
